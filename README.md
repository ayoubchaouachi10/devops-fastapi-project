🚀 DevOps & DevSecOps Pipeline
This project implements a complete CI/CD and DevSecOps pipeline using GitHub Actions, Docker, and multiple security tools to ensure code quality, security, and reliability.
🧩 Pipeline Overview
The DevOps pipeline is fully automated and triggered on push and pull requests.
It includes the following stages:
Continuous Integration (CI)
Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
Containerization & Image Publishing
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
✅ Continuous Integration (CI)
Tool: GitHub Actions
Trigger:
push on main
pull_request
CI Tasks
Install Python dependencies
Run automated tests using pytest
Fail the pipeline if tests fail
pytest -q
This ensures that only tested and working code is merged.
🔐 Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
Tool: Bandit
Bandit is used to statically analyze the Python source code and detect common security issues such as:
Use of insecure functions
Hardcoded secrets
Unsafe imports
bandit -r app
The pipeline fails if high-severity vulnerabilities are detected.
🐳 Docker & Containerization
Docker Image
The application is containerized using Docker.
Base image: python:3.12-slim
Application runs with Uvicorn
Exposes port 8000
Docker Hub Publishing
Tool: Docker Hub + GitHub Actions
On every successful push to main:
The Docker image is built
The image is pushed automatically to Docker Hub
Image name:
ayoubchaouachi10/devops-fastapi-project:latest
Pull the image manually:
docker pull ayoubchaouachi10/devops-fastapi-project:latest
🌐 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
Tool: OWASP ZAP (Baseline Scan)
DAST is performed using OWASP ZAP to analyze the running API from an attacker’s perspective.
DAST Workflow Steps:
Build the API Docker image
Run the API container locally (localhost:8000)
Execute OWASP ZAP baseline scan
Generate a security report as an artifact
The pipeline:
Detects common web vulnerabilities
Reports warnings without blocking development
Fails only on critical issues
⚠️ Some warnings (e.g., missing robots.txt) are expected for development APIs and do not indicate critical vulnerabilities.
📦 Artifacts & Reports
The following artifacts are generated by GitHub Actions:
OWASP ZAP security scan report
Docker build metadata
These artifacts allow reviewing security results after pipeline execution.
🏗️ Local Development
Run locally without Docker:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Run using Docker:
docker build -t devops-fastapi-project .
docker run -p 8000:8000 devops-fastapi-project
🎯 Summary
This project demonstrates:
Full CI/CD automation
Secure coding practices (SAST & DAST)
Containerized application delivery
Industry-standard DevSecOps workflow
The pipeline ensures that every change is tested, scanned, and securely deployed
